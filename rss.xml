&lt;summary&gt;Why I Chose the Cuckoo Bird as Kaito's Perfect Metaphor&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began researching Kaito's manipulation tactics, I needed an analogy that could capture the sophisticated nature of their exploitation without relying on overused crypto terminology like &amp;quot;rug pull&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;exit scam.&amp;quot; The cuckoo bird emerged as the perfect metaphor because it represents something far more insidious than simple theft—it embodies systematic deception, resource extraction, and ecosystem manipulation disguised as natural behavior. Unlike parasites that obviously harm their hosts, cuckoos have evolved to appear beneficial while secretly destroying the very communities that support them. The cuckoo doesn't just steal resources; it tricks other species into willingly sacrificing their own offspring to feed an imposter that will never reciprocate their investment. This mirrors exactly how Kaito infiltrates crypto projects and communities, convincing both sides to invest their most valuable resources—time, attention, money, and trust—into feeding a system that ultimately serves only Kaito's interests while systematically displacing genuine community development with manufactured engagement that benefits no one except the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI History Timeline: From Turing to Transformers</title><link>https://cryptowithshashi.github.io/posts/ai-history-timeline/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://cryptowithshashi.github.io/posts/ai-history-timeline/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I read a bunch of old papers and remembered fragments of the story, Turing’s imitation game, McCarthy’s Dartmouth proposal, ELIZA’s keyword tricks — and wanted to collect a readable timeline so my future self can quickly recall how AI evolved. Below I put the history in plain words, added technical notes where it helps, and suggested why each era mattered to what we see today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Support CWS Foundation</title><link>https://cryptowithshashi.github.io/donate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cryptowithshashi.github.io/donate/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="foundation-mission"&gt;Foundation Mission

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey I'm &lt;strong&gt;Shashi&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm a content creator and media manager focused on crypto. I've been documenting my learning notes on this blog since 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an expert in academic research or long-form journalism, but I transform what I learn into concise notes, practical tutorials, and small projects. I use AI heavily to help draft and prototype content, and I rely on tools and experiments to validate ideas. For my core work, I contribute to &lt;strong&gt;Netrum Labs&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an integrated Web3 infrastructure company building a merchant-grade platform that converges payments, multi-chain connectivity, decentralized infrastructure, and an infrastructure AI layer. And I've also been working on an open-source project called &lt;strong&gt;Crypto Library&lt;/strong&gt; on GitHub, which is an A → Z curated library of high-quality resources about blockchain, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, crypto security, tooling, research papers, and hands-on labs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
