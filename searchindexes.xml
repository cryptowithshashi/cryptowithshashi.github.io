Below I put the history in plain words, added technical notes where it helps, and suggested why each era mattered to what we see today.
Turing and the imitation game: the first &amp;amp;quot;can machines think?&amp;amp;quot; The AI story often starts with Alan Turing. In 1950 he asked a practical reframing of “Can machines think?” in his paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, and he described the thought experiment we now call the Turing Test or the “imitation game.” In that setup an interrogator asks questions (via text) to two hidden players — a human and a machine — and tries to tell which is which. If the machine can consistently fool the interrogator, Turing argued, we should be comfortable saying it “behaves like” thinking.
Turing wasn’t saying …  </content></entry><entry><title>Support CWS Foundation</title><url>/donate/</url><categories/><tags/><content type="html">  Foundation Mission The CWS Foundation is dedicated to advancing cryptocurrency education through comprehensive research, tutorials, and market analysis.

I'm a content creator and media manager focused on crypto. I've been documenting my learning notes on this blog since 2025.
I'm not an expert in academic research or long-form journalism, but I transform what I learn into concise notes, practical tutorials, and small projects. I use AI heavily to help draft and prototype content, and I rely on tools and experiments to validate ideas. For my core work, I contribute to Netrum Labs, which is an integrated Web3 infrastructure company building a merchant-grade platform that converges payments, multi-chain connectivity, decentralized infrastructure, and an infrastructure AI layer. And I've also been working on an open-source project called Crypto Library on GitHub, which is an A → Z curated library of high-quality resources about blockchain, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, crypto security, tooling, research papers, and hands-on labs.
GitHub hosts the code, and YouTube explains the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; this blog explains what I learn.
How I use this blog This site is primarily a learning notebook - short guides, notes, and worked examples that I create while learning and building. Expect practical posts, code snippets, and step-by-step walkthroughs rather than polished research papers.
If something here helped you, consider starring the related GitHub repo or sharing the post, it really helps. If you want to collaborate or ask a question, the fastest place to reach me is via GitHub issues or X (links above).
