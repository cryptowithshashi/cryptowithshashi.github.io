Below I put the history in plain words, added technical notes where it helps, and suggested why each era mattered to what we see today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI story often starts with Alan Turing. In 1950 he asked a practical reframing of “Can machines think?” in his paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, and he described the thought experiment we now call the Turing Test or the “imitation game.” In that setup an interrogator asks questions (via text) to two hidden players — a human and a machine — and tries to tell which is which. If the machine can consistently fool the interrogator, Turing argued, we should be comfortable saying it “behaves like” thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
